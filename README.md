DragonAssistant, A very simple assistant made with python to help me everyday ;)

** **
What can it do?
It can play music, tell me a joke, do a reboot/shutdown, start minecraft, start telegram, and many more. look at matches() function in dragonassistant.py to see basic skeleton of adding your own command and the already available commands
** **
How to install?
Use the following commands to install and run via terminal:

1.```git clone https://github.com/FrosT2k5/dragonassistant```

2.```cd dragonassistant```

3.```bash setup.sh```

And then you can run the assistant by doing

```python3 dragonassistant.py```

or 

```./dragonassistant.py```
** **
If you are using a non debian based distro, install python3, python3-pyaudio, python3-pip and espeak with yout distro's package manager

There are some FrosT's specific script like start telegram and start minecraft, you can make a bash script to do those and whatever else you want and change the path in the dragonassistant.py accordingly

You can even add your own functions if you have enough knowledge of python... Look at the matches() function of the script, the commands lie over there
** **
Possibilities are endless when you merge different libraries and apis with this bot... You can make this do a lots of things for you :)

Inspired from CodeWithHarry's Jarvis using python video, but code isnt kanged from there...
